## Move-App

### Status

The main purpose of this project is primarily for studying and your status is in initial stages of development.

With the Move-App I have applying various architecture concepts that I have studying in the last weeks, like [S.O.L.I.D Principles](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design), [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns), [Hexagonal Architecture](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)>), [Clean-Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

### About

Move-App is the place where gives you the power to get where you want to go

### Technologies

Move-App was designed to be lean and have your main parts developed with in-house solutions, but for the times that is not feasible to develop, I have been using the most popular technologies:

- Typescript
- Node.JS
- Docker & Docker-Compose
- PostgreSQL
- Jest
